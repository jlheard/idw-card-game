Project Summary

Simple project to build out a simple spin of the War card game, called I declare war. This will eventually lead to a project creating smart contracts with the same premise.

Introduction
---

This is a children's game played in many parts of the world. No strategy is involved - simply the ability to recognise which of two cards is higher in rank, and to follow the procedure of the game.

War for two players
======
In the basic game there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game.

Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26. Players do not look at their cards, but keep them in a packet face down. The object of the game is to win all the cards.

Both players now turn their top card face up and put them on the table. Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them (face down) to the bottom of their packet. Then both players turn up their next card and so on.

If the turned up cards are equal there is a war. The tied cards stay on the table and both players play three cards of their pile face down and then the fourth card face-up. (One card is placed down while per syllable while saying the phrase "I-De-clare-war!") Whoever has the higher of the new face-up cards wins the war and adds all six cards face-down to the bottom of their packet. If the new face-up cards are equal as well, the war continues: each player puts three cards face-down and one face-up. The war goes on like this as long as the face-up cards continue to be equal. As soon as they are different the player of the higher card wins all the cards in the war. If a player runs out of cards in a war then both players turn their last card face up in the series and the card determines the winner of the war.

The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins.
